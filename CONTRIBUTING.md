Contributing to LLY-DML
=============================

LLY-DML is part of the [LILY Project](https://www.lilyqml.de) and focuses on optimizing quantum circuits through differentiable machine learning (DML) techniques. We welcome contributions from the community to help enhance and expand our project. You can contribute in many ways, such as improving documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests, writing code, or providing feedback.

If you're interested in contributing, here’s how you can get involved.

Bug Reports
-----------

If you believe you’ve found a bug in LLY-DML, first make sure you’re using the [latest version of the project](https://www.lilyqml.de). If the issue persists, please check the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/lilyqml/lly-dml/issues) to see if someone has already reported it. If not, open a new issue, providing as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue.

If possible, include a small, reproducible example that highlights the problem. This makes it easier for us to investigate and resolve the bug.

Feature Requests
----------------

If you have ideas for new features or enhancements that could benefit LLY-DML, let us know by opening an issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/lilyqml/lly-dml/issues). Please describe your feature, the problem it solves, and how it could be implemented.

Contributing Code and Documentation
-----------------------------------

We encourage contributions to the LLY-DML codebase. If you want to contribute a new feature, fix a bug, or improve documentation, follow these steps:

### 1. Discuss Your Idea

Before starting, discuss your idea by opening an issue on GitHub. This helps ensure that no one else is working on the same feature or fix and allows us to provide guidance on the implementation.

### 2. Fork and Clone the Repository

Fork the LLY-DML repository on GitHub and clone it to your local machine. This will allow you to make changes to the codebase.

### 3. Make Your Changes

Make your changes in a new branch. Here are a few tips:

- Add relevant tests if you are modifying code.
- Ensure your code follows the project’s coding standards and is well-documented.
- Avoid making changes to code that are unrelated to your contribution.

### 4. Submit Your Changes

Once your changes are ready:

1. Run the tests to make sure nothing is broken.
2. Push your branch to your forked repository.
3. Create a pull request on the main LLY-DML repository, providing a clear description of your changes and linking to any relevant issues.

We will review your pull request, provide feedback, and work with you to get your contribution merged into the project.

### 5. Review Process

After submitting your pull request, it will go through a review process. We may ask for additional changes or clarifications. Once everything looks good, your contribution will be merged into the project.

Contributing as Part of a Class
-------------------------------

While we appreciate contributions made as part of a class assignment, we recommend that contributing to LLY-DML should not be required as a class task. The review process can take time, and we cannot guarantee that your pull request will be merged within any class deadlines.

If you want to contribute to LLY-DML as part of a class, please discuss your changes with us first and make the submission process optional and independent of class deadlines.
